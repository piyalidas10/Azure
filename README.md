```
A tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Microsoft Entra ID that contains an organization's resources, including registered apps and a directory of users. There are two ways to configure a tenant, depending on how the organization intends to use the tenant and the resources they want to manage:

A workforce tenant configuration is for your employees, internal business apps, and other organizational resources. You can invite external business partners and guests to your workforce tenant.
An external tenant configuration is used exclusively for External ID scenarios where you want to publish apps to consumers or business customers (learn more about External ID in external tenants)
